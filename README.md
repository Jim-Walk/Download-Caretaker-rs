# Download Caretaker

Script to help keep your downloads folder clean. Largely a clone of [the python Download Caretaker](https://github.com/Jim-Walk/Download-Caretaker) which I wrote. The script checks your downloads folder for files and dirs older than 30 days, and asks you what you want to do with them.
The (o)pen feature only works on Mac for now.

## Install

If you have cargo installed, then you can simply use
`cargo install download_caretaker`

To launch download caretaker each time you launch your terminal you can run the following command, depending on your shell.

### bash

`echo 'download_caretaker' >> ~/.bash_profile`

### zsh

`echo 'download_caretaker' >> ~/.zprofile`

## TODO

- [] Add open file feature for linux
