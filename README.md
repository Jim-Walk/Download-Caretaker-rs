# Download Caretaker

Script to help clean out your downloads folder. Largely a clone of [the python Download Caretaker](https://github.com/Jim-Walk/Download-Caretaker) which I wrote. The (o)pen feature only works on Mac for now.

## Install

If you have cargo installed, then you can simply use
`cargo install download_caretaker`

To launch download caretaker each time you launch your terminal you can run the following command, depending on your shell

### bash

`echo 'download_caretaker' >> ~/.bash_profile`

### zsh

`echo 'download_caretaker >> ~/.zprofile`

## TODO

- [] Add open file feature for linux
